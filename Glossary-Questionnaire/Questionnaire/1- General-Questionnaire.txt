1- How do humans interact with light?

Ans- Humans capture light through the eyes, which convert it into electrical signals processed by the brain to form visual images.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

2- What is vision, and why is it significant in human evolution?

Ans- Vision is the process of capturing and interpreting light, which was crucial in developing the complex nervous systems and large brains of humans.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------- ---)

3- How does the brain process visual information to perform actions, like kicking a ball?

Ans- The brain identifies objects, predicts their movement, and coordinates muscle actions in a split second, all based on visual inputs.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- Why don't humans need formal education to perform everyday tasks like kicking a ball?

Ans- Humans learn these tasks through trial and error during their upbringing, relying on innate cognitive abilities rather than formal education.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- What challenges arise when programming a computer to recognize a ball?

Ans- Defining what constitutes a ball is difficult due to variations in size, shape, and context, making rule-based programming challenging.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

6- Why can't rigid rule-based systems fully replicate human object recognition?

Ans- Human object recognition relies on context and generalization, whereas rigid systems lack the flexibility to adapt to different scenarios.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

7- How does computer vision differ from human vision?

Ans- Computer vision involves algorithms and models that process visual data differently from human vision, often focusing on specific tasks.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

8- Why is adaptability important in computer vision systems?

Ans- Adaptability allows computer vision systems to handle varied scenarios and context-rich environments, similar to human perception.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

9- What are some practical applications of computer vision in sports?

Ans- Computer vision can track balls in sports for real-time decisions and make events more accessible to those with visual impairments.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

10- How has the AI renaissance impacted computer vision?

Ans- The AI renaissance has enabled the creation of advanced computer vision models that can detect, generate, and describe images more effectively.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

11- What is an image in the context of computer vision?

Ans- An image is a visual representation of objects, scenes, or concepts, typically represented as a 2D function F(X,Y) where X and Y are spatial Coordinates.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

12- How is an image represented mathematically?

Ans- An image is represented as an n-dimensional function F(X,Y) with the function value indicating the intensity or gray level at a specific point.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

13- What do X and Y represent in an image function F(X,Y)?

Ans- X and Y represent the spatial coordinates of the image, often in a 2D Cartesian system.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

14- What is the significance of intensity in an image?

Ans- Intensity indicates the level of light and dark in an image, corresponding to the amplitude of the function at specific coordinates.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

15- What is a pixel in the context of images?

Ans- A pixel, or picture element, is the smallest unit of an image, representing the intensity at a specific coordinate pair (X,Y)

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

16- How are 3D images represented?

Ans- 3D images are represented by the function F(X,Y,Z), where X, Y, and Z are spatial coordinates, and each point is referred to as a voxel(volume element)

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

17- What is a voxel?

Ans- A voxel is the 3D equivalent of a pixel, representing a value in a volumetric image at coordinates (X, Y, Z)

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

18- What are image channels?

Ans- Image channels refer to the different color components of an image, with each channel representing intensity levels of a specific color, like red, green, or blue.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

19- What is the range of intensity values in a single color channel?

Ans- The intensity values in a color channel typically range from 0 to 255, where 0 represents no intensity and 255 represents maximum intensity.
