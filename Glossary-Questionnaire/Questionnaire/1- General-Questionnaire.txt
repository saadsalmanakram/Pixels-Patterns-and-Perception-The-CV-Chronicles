1- How do humans interact with light?

Ans- Humans capture light through the eyes, which convert it into electrical signals processed by the brain to form visual images.

2- What is vision, and why is it significant in human evolution?

Ans- Vision is the process of capturing and interpreting light, which was crucial in developing the complex nervous systems and large brains of humans.

3- How does the brain process visual information to perform actions, like kicking a ball?

Ans- The brain identifies objects, predicts their movement, and coordinates muscle actions in a split second, all based on visual inputs.

4- Why don't humans need formal education to perform everyday tasks like kicking a ball?

Ans- Humans learn these tasks through trial and error during their upbringing, relying on innate cognitive abilities rather than formal education.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- What challenges arise when programming a computer to recognize a ball?

Ans- Defining what constitutes a ball is difficult due to variations in size, shape, and context, making rule-based programming challenging.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

6- Why can't rigid rule-based systems fully replicate human object recognition?

Ans- Human object recognition relies on context and generalization, whereas rigid systems lack the flexibility to adapt to different scenarios.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

7- How does computer vision differ from human vision?

Ans- Computer vision involves algorithms and models that process visual data differently from human vision, often focusing on specific tasks.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

8- Why is adaptability important in computer vision systems?

Ans- Adaptability allows computer vision systems to handle varied scenarios and context-rich environments, similar to human perception.
